**Tested size:** 8 servings; makes about 9 cups

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
- 1 medium white onion, diced (1 cup)
- 1 medium red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced (1 cup)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more as needed
- 1 jalapeño pepper, minced (not seeded), plus fresh slices for serving
- 4 cloves garlic, minced and mashed
- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon Spanish smoked paprika (sweet pimenton)
- Two 15-ounce cans no-salt-added diced tomatoes, with juices
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 3/4 cups water, or more as needed
- 3/4 cup dried red lentils, rinsed and drained
- One 15-ounce can no-salt-added kidney beans, drained
- One 15-ounce can no-salt-added black beans, drained
- Chopped cilantro, for serving
- Diced avocado, for serving

## Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until it shimmers.
2. Stir in the onion and red bell pepper. Season with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and black pepper. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring often, until softened.
3. Add the jalapeño and mashed garlic, then stir in 2 tablespoons of the chili powder, half the cumin, all of the smoked paprika, the diced tomatoes with their juices, the tomato paste, and the water. Mix well.
4. Increase the heat to medium-high. Once it boils, stir in the lentils.
5. Reduce the heat to medium-low to keep the mixture barely bubbling, then cook for 15 minutes until the lentils are plumped and tender. Add more water if needed.
6. Incorporate the kidney and black beans, the remaining salt, black pepper, and the rest of the cumin and chili powder. Stir well.
7. Once the beans are heated through, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir occasionally and adjust the seasoning with more salt or pepper if needed.
8. Serve warm, topped with jalapeño slices, cilantro, and diced avocado.
