Yields: 2 to 4 servings
Prep time: 15 min
Cook time: 25 min

Ingredients:

1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
4 tablespoons butter
2 tart cooking apples, peeled, cored, and sliced into 1/4-inch slices
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

4 eggs, beaten and room temperature
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour or bread flour
1 cup milk, room temperature
1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
 1 teaspoon baking powder

Preparation:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place oven rack in the middle of your oven.

In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon; set aside.

In a large bowl, combine eggs, salt, flour, milk, and vanilla extract; beat until batter is smooth
(the batter will be thin, but very smooth and creamy); set aside.

In a large heavy ovenproof frying pan or a cast-iron skillet (I like to use my 10-inch cast-iron skillet)
over medium heat, melt butter, tilting pan to cover sides. Add apples and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon mixture.
Add lemon juice. Stir and let cook for 5 to 7 minutes to slightly cook the apple slices; remove from heat.

Pour prepared pancake batter over the apples into the baking pan. Place pan in preheated oven and bake
 approximately 20 minutes or until puffed above sides of the pan and lightly browned (it may puff
 irregularly in the center); remove from oven.

Remove pancake from the baking pan by flipping upside down onto a serving platter (apples and cinnamon 
will be on top). Once out of the oven, the pancake will begin to deflate.

To serve, cut into serving-size wedges and transfer to individual serving plates. Serve with an 
optional dusting of powdered sugar over the top.

-Alternatively, cook apples with 1/4 cup maple syrup and 1 tablespoon sugar, instead of sugar with cinnamon.
