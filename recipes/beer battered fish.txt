1 Can of Stale Beer
1 Cup of Flour
1 tsp of salt
1 tsp of sugar
1 tsp of baking soda
2 Eggs

Wash fish and make sure they are very dry.
Mix ingredients and dip fish in batter, letting excess drip off into bowl.
Fry until golden brown on both sides.

NOTES
Appears that 1 egg and slightly less than 1 can of beer would be good. 

Also, make sure to keep batter at a lumpy consistency.
