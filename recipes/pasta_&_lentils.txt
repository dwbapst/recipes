Tested size: 4 servings; makes about 7 cups
Ingredients

    1 cup dried brown lentils
    6 cups water, or more as needed
    2 large cloves garlic, minced
    1 small dried arbol chile pepper, broken into pieces, or 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more as needed
    1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
    1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt, or more as needed
    12 ounces dried pasta, preferably a small shape such as gnocchette, ditalini, orecchiette or cavatelli; or break spaghetti into 1-inch pieces
    2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped

Directions

Pour the lentils into a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven and add the water (to cover); bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.

Uncover; stir in the garlic, chile de arbol pieces and the oil, then cover and cook for 5 minutes.

Stir in the salt and the pasta, cover and cook until al dente, stirring regularly to keep the pasta from sticking and adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a minimum of bubbling. 

 - Depending on the pasta variety, the cooking time may take about 5 minutes longer than indicated on the package, so begin tasting the pasta once the suggested cooking time has elapsed. Continue tasting every minute or two until it is cooked through but still firm. The resulting dish should resemble a thick soup; if the mixture seems too dry, add a little water to reach the desired texture, keeping in mind the pasta will continue to absorb liquid as it cools.

Once the pasta is done, add the thyme. Taste and add more salt, as needed. Cover and let the mixture sit for 2 to 3 minutes, then uncover and drizzle with a little more oil just before serving, if desired.
