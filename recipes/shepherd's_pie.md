**Serves:** 4

## Ingredients

### For the lamb filling:
- 3 lb lamb, cut into 1/2" cubes
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 medium onions, diced
- 2 carrots, cut into 1/4" slices
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp flour
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1/4 cup red wine
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 cup peas, thawed if frozen

### For the mashed potatoes:
- 2 lb Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1" cubes
- 1 tsp salt
- 6 tbsp butter, softened
- 1/4 cup whole milk
- Black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Season lamb with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and brown the lamb in 2 batches, adding a bit more oil between batches if needed. Reserve the meat on a plate.
2. Add a tablespoon of oil to the skillet and reduce heat to medium. Sauté onions and carrots until onions are translucent and carrots are tender.
3. Stir in flour, tomato paste, garlic, thyme, and rosemary, and cook, stirring, for another 3 minutes.
4. Add chicken broth, wine, and Worcestershire sauce. Increase heat to high, bring just to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Partially cover the skillet and simmer for 25 minutes until lamb is tender.
5. Remove the skillet from heat and allow to cool.
6. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
7. Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until tender. Drain and add butter, milk, salt, and pepper. Mash coarsely.
8. Stir peas into the cooled meat mixture, then pour into a baking dish.
9. Spoon mashed potatoes over the meat mixture and gently spread to completely cover and seal the edges.
10. Place the baking dish on a center rack in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the top begins to brown.
