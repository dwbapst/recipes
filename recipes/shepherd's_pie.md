(Adapted from a recipe in American Classics by Cooks Illustrated)
Serves 4

3 lb lamb -- cut into 1/2” cubes
salt and pepper to taste
3 tbsp vegetable oil
2 ea md. onions -- diced
2 ea carrots -- cut into 1/4" slices
1 clove garlic -- minced
2 tbsp flour
1 tbsp tomato paste
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp dried rosemary
2 c chicken broth
1/4 c red wine
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 c peas -- thawed, if frozen
2 lb Yukon gold potatoes -- peeled and cut into 1" cubes
1 tsp salt
6 tbsp butter -- softened
1/4 c whole milk
black pepper

Season lamb with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown lamb in 2 batches -- adding a bit more oil between batches if needed. Reserve meat on a plate.

Add a tablespoon of oil to skillet and reduce heat to medium. Sauté onions and carrots until onions are translucent and carrots are tender. Stir in flour, tomato paste, garlic, thyme and rosemary and cook, stirring, for another 3 minutes. Add chicken broth, wine, and Worcestershire sauce. Increase heat to high, bring just to a boil then reduce the heat to low, partially cover skillet, and simmer for 25 minutes until lamb is tender. Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Heat oven to 400F.

In the meantime, boil potatoes until tender, drain, and add butter, milk, salt, and pepper. Mash coarsely.

Stir peas into meat mixture then pour into a baking dish. Spoon mashed potatoes over the top and gently spread to completely cover and seal edges. Place on a center rack in the oven and bake 20 to 25 minutes or until top begins to brown.
