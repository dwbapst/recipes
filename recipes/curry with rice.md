Curry

Ingredients
Protein (Shrimp, Chicken, Whatever - about 1-2 pounds)
1 Large Onion
~2 Cloves of Garlic
Jasmine Rice (or some other long-grain white rice)
Curry Powder (Trader Joe's from 2011 seems ideal...)
Fresh Basil Leaves

Additional Veggies:
	Carrots
	Potatoes
	Tomatoes
	Snap Peas
	Bell Pepper
	Broccoli?
	Etc.


1) Make the rice in a rice cooker.

2) Chop the vegetables, and if you're using chicken, chop the chicken.

3) Heat a large skillet with two Tbs of olive oil. When hot, add the onion, potatoes, carrots, etc. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for ~8 minutes, stirring regularly.

4) Add two teaspoons of curry powder and the garlic to the veggies. Stir so veggies get totally coated. 

5) Add the protein, along with a little more olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Add some moisture, maybe half a cup, if the vegetables are looking dry. (Depends on what vegetables you use). Add any vegetables that don't need to cook as long, like peppers and tomato, and stir. Cook until meat is properly browned (chicken isn't pink in the middle, shrimp is opaque, etc).

6) Stir in torn leaves of basil.

7) Either (a) mix cooked rice into the curry and serve, or (b) serve ontop of rice.

Thoughts - Potatoes might take longer to be fully cooked? Might need to add moisture when cooking first set of veggies. If we added coconut milk and fish sauce, we would be making a Thai curry, basically. Maybe try that sometime What is curry power, anyway?
