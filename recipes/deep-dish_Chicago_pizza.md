## Tips from Our Bakers
- For individual pizzas: Use a hamburger bun pan. Divide risen dough into 12 pieces. Bake individual crusts, fill, then bake for 20-25 minutes.
- Deep-dish pizza's crust has a flaky/tender texture, made with vegetable oil, olive oil, and butter. Cornmeal adds a subtle crunch.
