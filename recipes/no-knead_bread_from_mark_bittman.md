# No-Knead Bread

_Mark Bittman, [NYT](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread)_

**Yield**: One 1 1/2-pound loaf

## Ingredients

- 3 cups flour: all-purpose, bread, no more than 1 cup whole-wheat
- 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 5/8 cups water (possibly a little more if using whole-wheat flour)
- Additional flour for dusting
- Yellow cornmeal as needed for dusting

## Preparation

1. In a large bowl, combine flour, yeast, and salt. Add 1 5/8 cups water and stir until blended; the dough will be shaggy and sticky.
2. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees F.
3. The dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface with parchment paper and place the dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice.
4. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for about 15 minutes.
5. Using just enough flour to prevent sticking, gently shape the dough into a ball. Generously dust parchment paper with cornmeal or flour and place dough seam side down on it. Sprinkle with more flour or cornmeal.
6. Cover with a towel and let the dough rise for about 2 hours. It's ready when more than double in size and it doesn't readily spring back when poked.
7. At least 30 minutes before the dough is ready, heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex, or ceramic) in the oven as it heats.
8. Carefully remove the hot pot from the oven. Turn the dough over into the pot, seam side up. It may look uneven, but will even out as it bakes.
9. Cover with the lid and bake for 30 minutes. Then remove the lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until the loaf is browned. Cool on a rack.
