	Yield: One 1 1/2-pound loaf 

Ingredients
    3 cups flour: all-purpose, bread, no more than 1 cup whole-wheat!
    ¼ teaspoon instant yeast
    1 ¼ teaspoons salt
    
As Needed For Dusing
	More Flour (All-Purpose does fine)
	Yellow cornmeal as needed

Preparation

1) In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 5/8 cups water (maybe a little more if using whole-wheat flour), and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky.  

2) Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.

3) Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface (parchment paper!) and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and stretch and fold it over on itself once or twice. This objective is to align the gluten chains so they are parallel.

4) Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes. This allows more gluten chains to form. (Notice that you could keep doing this folding and giving short rests to make a more complex gluten network, but you're introducing oxygen into the dough which is hurting the yeast community. So don't do it too much.)

5) Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Dust parchment paper with cornmeal or flour and put dough seam side down. Dust with more flour/cornmeal.

6) Set timer for 1 and 1/2 hours. Cover with towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.

7) At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. 

8) When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
