4 	boneless skinless chicken breast halves 
	salt and pepper 
1/2 	cup flour 
1/2 	cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs 
1/4 	cup parmesan cheese 
1 	egg 
1/2 	cup milk 
1 	tablespoon butter 
2 	tablespoons olive oil 
	more parmesan cheese, for sprinkling on top 
4 	ounces sliced mozzarella cheese (if you can get it, the soft fresh kind is best - it melts sooooo creamy) 
	your favorite marinara sauce or store bought spaghetti sauce


Pound the chicken breasts between two slices of plastic wrap until about 1/4" thick.
Season with salt and pepper.
Dredge chicken in flour and shake off excess.
Dip in egg/milk mixture, then in breadcrumb/Parmesan mixture.
Heat the butter and olive oil in a large deep skillet.
Brown the chicken breasts over medium heat until golden on each side (about 2-3 min per side).
Remove to a plate and keep warm.
Add the marinara sauce to the skillet.
Heat to boiling and simmer 10 minutes.
Add the chicken breasts to the sauce and sprinkle Parmesan over them.
Place a slice of mozzarella on each piece of chicken.
Cover and simmer about 8- 10 minutes or until the cheese has melted and the chicken is tender.
Serve with your favorite pasta- we like linguine.
