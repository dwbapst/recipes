# Roasted Sweet Corn à la Nero Wolfe
*As mentioned by Nero Wolfe in "Murder is Corny"*

## Ingredients

- Fresh ears of corn, with husks
- Butter
- Salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to the highest possible temperature, aiming for 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
2. Prepare your fresh ears of corn by removing just the tip of the silk, if needed. Do not shuck the corn or remove the husks.
3. Place the ears of corn directly on the oven rack.
4. Roast for 40 minutes without any interruption.
5. Carefully remove the corn from the oven; it will be very hot.
6. At the table, husk the corn to reveal the steamed kernels.
7. Butter the roasted corn generously.
8. Sprinkle with salt to taste.
9. Enjoy the simple yet heavenly taste of perfect roasted corn—nothing else required!

Remember, as Nero Wolfe says, this preparation transforms sweet corn into ambrosia!
