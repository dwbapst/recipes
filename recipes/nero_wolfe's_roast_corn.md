"Boiled in water, sweet corn is.. edible, and nutritious.  But roasted in an oven, at the hottest possible temperature for 40 minutes. Shucked at the table. Buttered. Salted. Nothing else! Ambrosia." - Nero Wolfe, in Murder is Corny

Get FRESH FRESH ears of corn

Do nothing to them, except maybe just remove the tip of the silk

Heat oven to 500 degrees

Put ears directly on the rack

Wait 40 minutes

Remove, husk at table, butter, salt, nothing else! AMBROSIA!
