Based on https://www.primaverakitchen.com/italian-sausage-onions-and-peppers-skillet/


Ingredients

- Penne Pasta
- Sausage: Italian Sausage, Smoked Polish Sausage, etc
- White and Red Onion (sliced into 1 inch pieces)
- Bell Pepper (Green, Red, Yellow; sliced into 1 inch pieces)
- Liquid for Deglazing (Red Wine, White Wine, Apple Cider, etc)
- Stuff to add on top of pasta: fresh basil leaves, shaved Parmesan cheese, etc.


1) Boil salted water for penne pasta, add penne pasta, drain and add olive oil so the pasta doesn't stick.

2 ) While the water is boiling, heat oil in a skillet.

3) Add sausage, preferably whole. Cook for ~3 minutes until the sausage is browned on all sides. 

4) Remove the sausage and slice into discs. While the sausage may not be cooked through yet, we will cook them more in a bit.

5) If you need to, add more olive oil if necessary. 

6) Saut√© the peppers and onions in the same skillet for about three minutes, without wiping it out. 

7) Deglaze the pan, by adding white wine, red wine or apple cider to the pan, and scrapping the bottom of the pan with your spatula. 

8) Add the sliced sausage and reduce heat to low, and allow to simmer. Depending on how un-cooked the sausage continues to, or how crisp you want the vegetables to be, you may cover and allow to cook covered for 10 minutes.

9)Top pasta with sausage and vegetables from pan, and top with Parmesan cheese and freshly chopped basil.
