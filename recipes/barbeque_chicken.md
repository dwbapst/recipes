## Instructions for the Grill

1. Prepare the grill for direct cooking at high heat (450°F). Clean the cooking grates.

2. Drizzle chicken breasts with extra virgin olive oil, then season with kosher salt and black pepper.

3. Place chicken on the hot grill, cover, and cook for 5-6 minutes until they release easily from the grates.

4. Flip the chicken and cook for an additional 4-5 minutes.

5. Baste with BBQ sauce, flip, baste again, and cook for 2 minutes on each side.

6. Cook until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160°F (will rise to 165°F as it rests).
