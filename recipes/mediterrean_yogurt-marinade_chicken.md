**Servings**: 4-6  
**Prep Time**: 20 Minutes  
**Cook Time**: 15 Minutes  
**Total Time**: 35 Minutes, plus 8 hours to marinate

## Ingredients

- 1 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (reduce to 1/2 teaspoon if you prefer less heat)
- Zest from one lemon
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, from one lemon
- 1-3/4 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 2-1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into large bite-sized pieces (or 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts)
- 1 large red onion, cut into wedges
- Vegetable oil, for greasing the grill

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, mix together the Greek yogurt, olive oil, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and minced garlic.
2. Thread the chicken onto metal skewers, folding if necessary, and alternate with red onion wedges. Avoid crowding the skewers. (You will need between 6-8 skewers.)
3. Place the skewers on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
4. Generously apply the marinade to the chicken, ensuring it is well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight.
5. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Grease the grill by lightly dipping paper towels in vegetable oil and, using tongs, rub the oil over the grates several times until they appear glossy and coated.
6. Grill the chicken kebabs until they are golden brown and fully cooked, turning occasionally, for about 10 to 15 minutes. The yogurt will create a thick marinade that sticks to the chicken, forming a crust as it cooks.
7. Once done, transfer the skewers to a platter and serve.
