# Ratatouille

**Servings:** 4  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Preparation Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cooking Time:** 1 hour

## Ingredients

- 4 tbsp Olive oil
- 2 medium Onions, quartered
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 2 green peppers, roughly diced (substitute: 1 sweet potato, thinly sliced)
- 2 large eggplants, halved horizontally then sliced into 3cm pieces
- 3 medium zucchini, sliced into 3cm pieces (include yellow squash for color)
- 14.5 oz can (400g) of chopped tomatoes, drained
- Small bunch Basil, leaves torn
- Brown rice, for serving (alternative to sourdough bread)

## Method

1. Heat oil in a large flat saucepan with a lid and sweat the onions and garlic for 10 minutes on a low heat, covered.

2. Add the sweet potato and eggplant first. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook for 5 minutes. Then add the squash and zucchini, season again, and continue to cook for another 20 minutes covered, or until all the vegetables look relatively well cooked.

3. Pour in the chopped tomatoes, give it a stir, and check the seasoning. Cook for a further 5 minutes without the lid. Stir in the basil.

4. Serve the ratatouille over brown rice instead of sourdough, as per the updated personal preference.

**Note:** The recipe has been modified to replace peppers with sweet potato and suggests serving over brown rice instead of sourdough bread. Make sure to slice all the vegetables very thin and use a big flat saucepan with a lid for cooking.
