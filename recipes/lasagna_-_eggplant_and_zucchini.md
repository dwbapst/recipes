# Veggie Low-Fat Lasagna

## Ingredients

- Lasagna Noodles (1 Box)
- 1.5 bottles of marinara sauce
- 1 Chopped Onion
- Sliced Zucchini, Yellow Squash
- Diced Eggplant
- Chopped Garlic
- Egg Whites (1 Cup-ish)
- Fat-Free Ricotta Cheese (15 oz, small container)
- Low-Fat Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
- Optional: Shredded Parmesan Cheese

## Instructions

1. Grease pan and spread a quarter of a bottle of marinara sauce on the bottom.
   - **NOTE**: Save the remaining quarter for the end!
2. Sauté the eggplant, onion, and garlic.
3. Add the zucchini and squash halfway through.
4. Boil noodles according to the package instructions.
5. Once the vegetables are cooked, add marinara to the pan and season to taste.
6. Drain the noodles and lay them out on flat surfaces to cool.
7. In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta, egg whites, mozzarella, and parmesan (if using). Ensure the mixture is somewhat soupy by adding enough egg whites.
8. Begin preheating the oven at this point.
9. Layer noodles at the bottom of the pan, cover with cheese mixture, then add some sauce and vegetables.
   - **NOTE**: Use up the cheese sauce and vegetable sauce mix before the last noodle layer!
10. Repeat the layering process, ending with a layer of noodles topped with the reserved quarter bottle of marinara sauce.
11. Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 375°F for 20 minutes.
    - **NOTE**: Consider placing a larger pan underneath to catch any drippings.
12. Remove from the oven, add more mozzarella cheese on top, then recover with foil and bake for another 10 minutes.

Enjoy your low-fat veggie lasagna!

## Alternate Version: Spinach and Mushroom (no eggplant, onion, or zucchini)

- Sufficient mushrooms to fill a frying pan (Portobello recommended)
- Enough fresh spinach to fill a large pot (remove stems)
- Additional garlic (about 3 cloves)

For the alternate version:

1. Halve the garlic. Put one half in a large pot.
2. Prepare spinach, removing stems to fill the pot.
3. Rinse spinach and simmer on low heat with the lid on.
4. Clean mushrooms well, keeping gills on.
5. Heat oil, butter, and remaining garlic in a pan. Once butter melts, add mushrooms gill-side down, season with salt.
6. Sauté mushrooms until they release their juices.
7. Combine cooked mushrooms and simmered spinach with one jar of marinara sauce and season as desired.
8. Continue with step 4 from the main recipe.
