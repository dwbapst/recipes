Modified from: https://www.campbells.com/recipes/ultimate-chicken-pot-pie/


Ingredients
2 pre-made pie crusts
1 can (10 1/2 ounces) Cream of Chicken Soup 
1/2 cup milk
2 cups cubed cooked chicken
1 package (12 ounces) frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, green beans, corn, peas), thawed (about 2 2/3 cups)

Instructions

1) Heat the oven to 400°F.  

2) Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate with 1 pie crust.  Trim any excess.

3) Stir the soup, milk, chicken and vegetables in a medium bowl. Add milk carefully so it is creamy, and does not have too much liquid.

4) Spoon the chicken mixture into the pie plate.  Place the remaining pie crust over the filling.  Trim any excess.  Crimp the edges of the top and bottom crusts together.  

5) Using a sharp knife, cut several slits in the top crust.

6) Bake for 35 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. 


Tips & Variations

- Can add cheddar cheese (ugh, why?)

- Can make as a freezer meal. Assemble as directed, wrap tightly and freeze.  From frozen, bake, covered, at 400°F. for 1 hour.  Uncover.  Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes more or until golden brown.  Or, thaw in the refrigerator and bake, covered, for 50 minutes, then uncover and bake for 35 minutes more or until golden brown.
