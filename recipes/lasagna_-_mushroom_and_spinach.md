Mushroom and Spinach Lasagna

Lasagna Noodles (1 Box)
1.5 bottles of marinara sauce
Several Small Portobello Mushrooms
	(enough to fill a frying pan)
10 oz Chopped Frozen Spinach (small 'box')
~3 Large Cloves of Garlic
Egg Whites (~1 Cup)
Low-Fat Ricotta Cheese (32 oz, large container)
	(Can use non-fat ricotta to further cut fat/cholesterol.)
Low-Fat Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
Optional: Shredded Parmasan Cheese

1) Grease pan, spread a quarter of a bottle of marinara on bottom
	NOTE: save remaining quarter for the end!
2) Start boiling water in large pot for noodles.
3) Chop garlic. 
4) Clean mushrooms well, but leave gills on. Do not chop.
	-May want to remove mushroom stems, as these can be tougher texture.
5) Put spinach in glass bowl, microwave until defrosted.
6) Saute garlic in a pan with several tablespoons of olive oil and low-fat butter.
7) Place mushrooms in pan, gill-side down. (Salt?) 
8) Saute using spatula to 'chop' into smaller pieces, until mushroom juices run.
9) Mix mushrooms and spinach into 1 jar of marinara sauce. Season.
4) Boil noodles (Usually around 14 min)
6) When noodles are done, lay out on flat objects
7) Mix Ricotta, egg whites, mozzarella, parmasan (if have any)
   -Make sure to add enough egg white so somewhat soupy
8) DAVE, BEGIN PREHEATING THE OVEN NOW!
9) Put down noodles, cover in cheese mix, then put on some sauce
	NOTE: use up cheese sauce and veggies+sauce mix before last noodle layer!
10) repeat layering until the last layer, which is just sauce (that left-over quarter!)
11) Bake 20 min at 375 with aluminum foil cover
	NOTE: Consider putting a larger pan underneath to catch any unwanted drippings!
12) Add mozzarella cheese on top
13) Recover with foil and bake 10 min more

Enjoy!
