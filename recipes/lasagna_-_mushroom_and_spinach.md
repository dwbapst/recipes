# Mushroom and Spinach Lasagna

## Ingredients

- Lasagna Noodles (1 Box)
- 1.5 bottles of marinara sauce
- Several Small Portobello Mushrooms (enough to fill a frying pan)
- 10 oz Chopped Frozen Spinach (small 'box')
- ~3 Large Cloves of Garlic
- Egg Whites (~1 Cup)
- Low-Fat Ricotta Cheese (32 oz, large container)
  - Can use non-fat ricotta to further cut fat/cholesterol.
- Low-Fat Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
- Optional: Shredded Parmesan Cheese

## Instructions

1. Grease the bottom of the pan and spread a quarter of a bottle of marinara sauce on it.
   - **NOTE**: Save the remaining quarter for the end.
2. Start boiling water in a large pot for the noodles.
3. Chop the garlic.
4. Clean the mushrooms well, but leave the gills on. Do not chop them. Optionally, remove the mushroom stems if desired for texture preference.
5. Place the spinach in a glass bowl and microwave until defrosted.
6. Sauté the garlic in a pan with several tablespoons of olive oil and low-fat butter.
7. Add the mushrooms to the pan, gill-side down. Optionally, season with salt.
8. Sauté and use a spatula to chop the mushrooms into smaller pieces until their juices are released.
9. Mix the mushrooms and spinach into one jar of marinara sauce. Season as desired.
10. Boil the noodles until al dente, usually around 14 minutes.
11. Once the noodles are done, lay them out on flat objects to prevent sticking.
12. In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta, egg whites, mozzarella, and parmesan (if using). The mixture should have a somewhat soupy consistency.
13. DAVE, BEGIN PREHEATING THE OVEN NOW at 375°F!
14. Layer noodles in the pan, followed by the cheese mixture, and then some of the mushroom and spinach sauce mixture.

- **NOTE**: Be sure to use up the cheese sauce and veggies+sauce mix before the last noodle layer!

15. Repeat the layering process, ending with just the leftover quarter of the marinara sauce on the final layer of noodles.
16. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes.

- **NOTE**: Consider placing a larger pan underneath to catch any spills or drippings.

17. Remove from oven, add more mozzarella cheese on top, then recover with foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes.
