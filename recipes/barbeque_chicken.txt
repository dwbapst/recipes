1) Prepare the grill for direct cooking at high heat (450°F). Brush the cooking grates clean.

2) Drizzle the chicken breasts with extra virgin olive oil and rub over the breasts. Season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.

3) Place the chicken breasts on the hot grill. Cover and cook for 5-6 minutes or until they easily release from the grates. 

4) Flip the chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes longer. 

5) Baste the chicken breasts with BBQ sauce, flip, baste and cook for 2 minutes on one side. 

6) Flip, baste as needed, and cook for 2 minutes  on the other side. Cook until the breasts are firm to the touch and opaque all the way through, registering 160°F internal temp (the temp will rise to 165°F as the chicken rests).
