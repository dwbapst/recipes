Fake Beef Stew
Carrots, potatoes, onions, garlic in an oven proof dish. Coat lightly with oil, salt, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper. Cover with foil. Roast at ~400F. Ever so often shake the pan. You want things fairly well caramelized.

While this is going on get your crock pot going on medium with about 2 cups of water with 2 teaspoons of Fake Beef Better then Bullion added in. Toss in 2 bay leaves, a couple of chopped shallots, and a little cayenne. I used chipotle instead.

When the roasted veggies are done pull out the pan. They should be lightly burnt. Deglaze with 1 cup of red wine or one cup of stout. Toss all this into the crock pot.

In a skillet slice your mushrooms and brown on both sides. Add to crock pot. Let simmer away.

Near the last hour of cooking brown your seitan in a pan with some oil. Toss into the stew.

*You don't need a crock pot. This can all be done stovetop a well.

** You can thicken this with a roux and make a fake meat pie too!!!!

* For tastier seitan pour fake beef broth over the seitan after it's browned and reduce the sauce
