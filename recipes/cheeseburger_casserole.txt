Kid-friendly and delicious! If you’re a cheeseburger lover, and the thought of ground beef, tomatoes, pickles and cheese tickles your fancy, then this truly American, comforting Cheeseburger Casserole is for you!

Ingredients:

    2 cups (6 oz) uncooked rotini pasta (use brown rice pasta for GF)
    2 tsp olive oil	
    1 1/2 cups onions, finely chopped
    1 garlic clove, finely chopped
    1 lb lean ground beef (95% lean) / OR VEGGIE GROUND
    3/4 tsp salt
    1/2 tsp black pepper
    2 tbsp tomato paste
    28 oz diced tomatoes
    2 cups reduced-fat grated cheddar cheese

Directions:

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta according to the package directions for al dente and drain well.

In a extra-large skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.

Stir in the beef and cook until browned; season with salt and pepper.

Stir in the tomato paste, then add the tomatoes. If desired, add 2 tbsp Dijon Mustard (this is an acquired taste).

Let the mixture bubble gently until it is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.

Toss the pasta into the skillet with the tomato mixture and top with shredded cheddar. Cover and let sit to melt cheese.
