# Irish Soda Bread

- 4 cups flour
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) softened margarine
- 4 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking power
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 large egg

1) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.

2) Mix flour, softened margarine, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in 1 cup of buttermilk and egg. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead slightly. Form dough into a round loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet. Note that the dough will be a little sticky.

- 1/4 cup melted butter/margerine (1/2 stick)
- 1/4 cup buttermilk

3) Combine melted butter with 1/4 cup buttermilk in a small bowl; brush loaf with this mixture. Use a sharp knife to cut an 'X' into the top of the loaf.

4) Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Check for doneness after 30 minutes. You may continue to brush the loaf with the butter mixture while it bakes.

Ingredients

    1 T unsalted butter
    4 cups all purpose flour, plus more for sprinkling (16 oz)
    1 tsp baking soda
    1 1/2 tsp salt
    1 ¾ cups buttermilk (14 oz)

Instructions

    Preheat the oven to 425° F. Grease a dutch oven with butter and dust with flour to prevent the bread from sticking.
    Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl, then stir in the buttermilk to form a sticky dough. Gather and knead the dough gently for 1 minute, shaping into a thick round disk (about the size of your dutch oven).
    Lay the dough flat in the dutch oven, cover, and bake 30 minutes on the center rack. Uncover and bake for an additional 14 minutes until the bread is golden brown and hollow sounding when tapped.
    Cover the bread in a clean towel and lightly sprinkle with water to keep the bread from drying out. Best enjoyed fresh, but will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days. Serve bread toasted with butter and jam to preserve the crusty texture.
