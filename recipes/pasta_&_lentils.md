# Pasta and Lentils (Pasta e Lenticchie)

*[Recipe from The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/red-lentil-chili/16104/?utm_term=.6541f0989251)*

**Tested size:** 4 servings; makes about 7 cups

## Ingredients

- 1 cup dried brown lentils
- 6 cups water, or more as needed
- 2 large cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small dried arbol chile pepper, broken into pieces (or 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more as needed)
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
- 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt, or more as needed
- 12 ounces dried pasta, preferably small shapes such as gnocchette, ditalini, orecchiette, or cavatelli; or break spaghetti into 1-inch pieces
- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped

## Directions

1. Pour the lentils into a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven. Add the water to cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.
2. Uncover the pot, then stir in the minced garlic, chile de arbol pieces (or red pepper flakes), and olive oil. Cover and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
3. Stir in the sea salt and add the pasta to the pot. Cover and cook until the pasta is al dente, regularly stirring to prevent sticking and adjusting the heat to maintain a gentle boil.
   - The pasta may take about 5 minutes longer to cook than the package indicates. Start tasting for doneness once the package's suggested cooking time has elapsed, and continue tasting every couple of minutes until the pasta is cooked but still firm.
   - If the mixture seems dry, add water to reach the desired thick soup-like texture. Note that the pasta will continue to absorb liquid as it cools.
4. Once the pasta is cooked, stir in the fresh thyme. Taste and add more salt if needed.
5. Cover the pot and allow the mixture to sit for 2 to 3 minutes. Then uncover and drizzle with a bit more olive oil just before serving, if desired.
