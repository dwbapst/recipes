## Yields

2 to 4 servings

## Prep Time

15 min

## Cook Time

25 min

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2 tart cooking apples, peeled, cored, and sliced into 1/4-inch slices
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 4 eggs, beaten and room temperature
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup all-purpose flour or bread flour
- 1 cup milk, room temperature
- 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking powder

## Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place oven rack in the middle of your oven.
2. In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon; set aside.
3. In a large bowl, combine eggs, salt, flour, milk, and vanilla extract; beat until batter is smooth (the batter will be thin, but very smooth and creamy); set aside.
4. In a large heavy ovenproof frying pan or a cast-iron skillet (preferably 10-inch cast-iron) over medium heat, melt butter, tilting pan to cover sides. Add apples and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon mixture. Add lemon juice. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes to slightly cook the apple slices; remove from heat.
5. Pour prepared pancake batter over the apples into the baking pan. Bake approximately 20 minutes or until puffed above sides of the pan and lightly browned. Remove from oven.
6. Remove pancake from the baking pan by flipping upside down onto a serving platter (apples and cinnamon will be on top). The pancake will begin to deflate once out of the oven.
7. Serve in wedges with an optional dusting of powdered sugar over the top.

**Note**: Alternatively, cook apples with 1/4 cup maple syrup and 1 tablespoon sugar, instead of sugar with cinnamon.
