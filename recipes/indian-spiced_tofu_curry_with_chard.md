From The Food We Eat - [Recipe from POPSUGAR](https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Healthy-Indian-Tofu-Curry-5477629)

## Ingredients

- 1 large bunch of red Swiss chard or rainbow chard (around 16 to 18 leaves)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 tablespoon ginger, minced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes
- 1 teaspoon cumin powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tomato, chopped
- 1 block extra-firm tofu, cubed
- 1 cup water
- 1/4 cup roasted cashews, for garnish
- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, for garnish

## Directions

1. Rip leaves of chard off stalks and set stalks aside. Chop the chard leaves into bite-size pieces, then wash and drain thoroughly. Rinse the stalks and chop them as well.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large pan. Sauté the onions, garlic, and ginger until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add the chard stalks and sauté for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Add the turmeric, garam masala, cumin powder, red chili flakes, and salt to the pan. Sauté for 3 to 5 minutes until the spices are fragrant.
4. Add the chopped tomato and cook until the tomatoes break down.
5. Add the chard leaves and cook on medium-high just until the leaves wilt, which should take about 3 minutes.
6. Stir in the tofu and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes until the chard is cooked down and the flavors have melded together.
7. Sprinkle with roasted cashews and chopped cilantro just before serving.
