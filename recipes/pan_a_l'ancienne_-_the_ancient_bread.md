# Pan a l'Ancienne (Classic French Baguettes)

**Makes**: 3-4 [or 6-8] baguettes

## Ingredients

- 3 [6] cups flour (100% bread flour recommended; can use 2/3 all-purpose, 1/3 bread flour)
- 1.12 [2.25] tsp salt
- 1 [1.75] tsp instant yeast
- 1.12 [2.25] cups ice-cold water
- ~1 cup more of ice-cold water
- Flour for dusting
- Cornmeal for dusting (optional)
- Vegetable oil for greasing

## Instructions

1. To prepare ice-cold water, refrigerate water with ice cubes until it reaches 40°F.
2. Mix the flour, salt, yeast, and the first portion of water. Add water little by little, mixing to a very sticky consistency without over-handling (to keep the dough cold). Knead for 5-6 minutes.
3. Cover and refrigerate overnight to retard rising, minimizing door opening to keep it cold.
4. The next day, let the dough come to room temperature and begin to rise until doubled (2-3 hours).
5. An hour or two before baking, place a pizza stone and a sacrificial sheet pan in the oven and preheat to 500°F. Preheat for 45 minutes.
6. Lightly oil and optionally dust a parchment paper with cornmeal on a breadmaker's paddle or inverted sheet pan.
7. Transfer the dough to a well-floured counter very carefully to preserve gases, and shape into a flat oblong.
8. Cut the dough into two equal pieces, then into strips for baguettes using a pinching action.
9. Stretch the strips to fit the size of the pizza stone and place them on the prepared parchment paper.
10. Shape the loaves by folding the seams under.
10a. Have a spray bottle with warm water and 2-3 cups of water on hand.
11. Let the shaped dough rest for 5 minutes, covered with plastic wrap.
12. Score the tops of the loaves with 3-4 diagonal cuts.
13. Slide the parchment paper onto the pizza stone and pour the water into the heated pan.
14. Spray the oven walls twice at 30-second intervals, then reduce heat to 475°F.
15. Check for a dark brown color after 6-8 minutes, rotate if necessary, then bake for another 10-15 minutes.
16. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack for 20 minutes.
