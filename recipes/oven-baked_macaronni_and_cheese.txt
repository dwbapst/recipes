Oven-Baked Macaronni and Cheese

Ingredients

   16 ounces elbow macaroni (or your favorite short pasta)

   1/4th cup (half a stick) Butter

   2 tablespoons of Flour (for the roux)

   2 cups of milk (use whole milk for richness)

   1.5 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese (3/4 of a typical block of cheese)

   1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese (1/2 of a typical block)


Instructions:

1) Preheat oven to 350 deg F.

2) Boil the macaroni in salted water until just al dente. Drain and set aside.

3) In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.

4) Stir in the flour until smooth. Season with salt and pepper as desired. Cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly.

5) Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring frequently to avoid lumps. Cook until the mixture thickens and bubbles slightly.

6) Remove the saucepan from the heat. Stir in 1 cup of sharp cheddar and Â¾ cup of Monterey Jack until completely melted and smooth.

7) Combine cheese sauce with the cooked macaroni by stirring the pasta into the cheese sauce, folding such that every piece is coated.

8) Pour the mixture into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish.

9) Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese evenly on top.

10) Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and lightly golden. Let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.
