# 48-hour Homemade Sourdough
### From Ara Kooser

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cups flour
- 2 cups hot water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Additional flour for later steps
- Warm water for later steps

#### Directions:

1. Mix 2 cups flour, 2 cups hot water, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl.
2. Let the mixture stand uncovered for 24 hours.
3. After 24 hours, add 1/2 cup flour and enough warm water to the mixture until it is thin.
4. Leave the mixture for another 24 hours.
5. Gradually add flour to the dough until it becomes tacky in texture.
6. Fold the dough once every hour for three hours.
7. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) with a Dutch oven inside.
8. Place the dough in the preheated Dutch oven and bake for 25 minutes with the lid on.
9. Remove the lid and finish baking for an additional 20 minutes.

#### Notes:
- This recipe is similar to making a very quick overnight poolish, then making the entire poolish into a loaf.
- The bread tends to dry out quickly, especially in dry climates like South Dakota. Keep it covered with plastic wrap or place in a puddle of water, constantly turning it to prevent the dough's surface from drying out.
- Expect to use about 4 cups of flour in total due to repeated addition throughout the 48-hour period.
- The inside of the loaf may smell strongly of sour and alcohol vapors for the first 24 hours. It may be better to let it sit for more than a day before trying to eat it as the smell might be overpowering initially.
- Despite the strong smell, the loaf should not develop harmful bacteria, as these organisms cannot thrive on flour and water alone.
- The sourdough can have a strong and pungent taste, even after 24 hours of baking. It pairs well with butter and cheese and has a relatively long shelf life without going stale.
