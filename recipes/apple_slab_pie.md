## Ingredients

- 2 Large Apples (~1 lb), less sweet variety like Granny Smith, peeled, cored, cut into 1/3″ slices
- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup brown sugar, lightly packed
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 sheet (8 or 9 oz) frozen puff pastry, thawed
- All-purpose flour for dusting
- 1 egg, lightly beaten for egg wash
- Coarse sugar for sprinkling (can use regular granulated sugar)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400˚F.
2. Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet or dutch oven. Add sliced apples and cook until lightly browned (6-8 min).
3. Reduce heat to low, add brown sugar and cinnamon. Simmer until apples are soft and caramelized (5 min).
4. Dust a parchment paper with flour. Roll out thawed puff pastry dough to flatten (9 & 1/2 by 10 & 1/2 inches).
5. Cut pastry dough in half to make two pieces (each 4 & 3/4 by 10 & 1/2 inches).
6. Arrange apples on one pastry sheet, leaving a one-inch border. Pour remaining syrup from the apples on top.
7. Brush edges with egg wash. Top with the second pastry sheet and press edges to seal.
8. Cut 6 (1-inch) slits down the center. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse sugar.
9. Bake for 15-17 min at 400˚F until golden brown.
