# Pasta with Sausage & Peppers

Inspired by a recipe from [Primavera Kitchen](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/italian-sausage-onions-and-peppers-skillet/)

## Ingredients

- Penne Pasta
- Italian Sausage, Smoked Polish Sausage, etc.
- 1 White Onion, sliced into 1-inch pieces
- 1 Red Onion, sliced into 1-inch pieces
- Bell Peppers (Green, Red, Yellow; sliced into 1-inch pieces)
- Liquid for deglazing (Red Wine, White Wine, Apple Cider, etc.)
- Olive oil
- Fresh basil leaves (for garnishing)
- Shaved Parmesan cheese (for topping)

## Directions

1. Boil a pot of salted water and cook penne pasta according to the package instructions. Drain and toss with a bit of olive oil to prevent sticking.
2. While pasta is cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
3. Add the whole sausages to the skillet. Cook for approximately 3 minutes or until browned on all sides.
4. Remove sausages from the skillet and slice them into discs. They will not be fully cooked yet and will continue cooking later.
5. If necessary, add more olive oil to the skillet.
6. Saut√© the sliced peppers and onions in the same skillet for about 3 minutes.
7. Deglaze the pan by adding your choice of wine or apple cider, scraping the bottom of the pan with a spatula to loosen any browned bits.
8. Return the sliced sausage to the skillet, reducing the heat to low. Let it simmer. Cover and cook for 10 minutes if you prefer the sausage well-done and the vegetables soft.
9. Serve the sausage and vegetables over the prepared penne pasta.
10. Top with shaved Parmesan cheese and fresh basil before serving.
