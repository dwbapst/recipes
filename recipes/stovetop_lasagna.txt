Total Time: 30 Minutes

Ingredients:
1 1/2 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 Onion, chopped
1 cup Mushrooms, chopped
2 cloves Garlic, minced
2 (14.5 oz) Cans Diced Italian Tomatoes, drained (each can is about 3-4 diced Roma tomatoes)
1/4 cup Tomato Sauce
3 Leaves Basil, chopped
1/4 tsp Black Pepper
1 tsp Sea Salt
1 cup Ricotta Cheese (THAT'S HALF OF A SMALL CONTAINER OF RICOTTA, WHICH IS USUALLY 2 CUPS)
1/2 cup Part Skim Mozzarella, shredded
3 Tbsp shredded Parmesan
8 ounces Lasagna noodles, broken into thirds and cooked (about 1/2 of a Lasagna noodle box, which is usually 16 oz)
3 Tbsp Parsley

Directions:
Boil salted water for cooking lasagna noodles. 

Take 1/2 of a typical Lasagna noodle box, breaking noodles into thirds. Boil noodles for 10-12 minutes then drain.

Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Add onions and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. 

Add garlic and mushrooms and cook until garlic is fragrant, about one minute. 

Add in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, basil, salt and pepper. Cook mixture until it thickens up a bit, around five minutes.

Add cooked noodles to skillet and stir into the mixture well. 

Take half of a small ricotta container (two cup) and scoop ricotta over the noodles.

Add in mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, and stir in parsley. Cook about two more minutes, or until thickened.

Serve with additional basil on top.
