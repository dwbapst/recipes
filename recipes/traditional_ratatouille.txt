How We Have It (08-21-12, updatd 10-22-14)
Get a sweet potato, not peppers. Get yellow squash to go with zucchini for color. Slice everything very thin.
	-Make sure to use a big flat sauce pan with lid, not a pot.
1) For step 2, add Sweet Potato and aubergine (eggplant) alone, then add squash and zucchini 5 minutes later. Season. Cook 20 minutes, then go to step 3, when everything looks relatively well cooked.
2) Serve over brown rice, not sourdough. Who likes sourdough?
