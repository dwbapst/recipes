# Honey Wheat Bread

## Ingredients

- Active dry yeast: 1 & 1/8 teaspoon (or 2 & 1/4 tsp for two loaves)
- Warm water: 1 cup (or 2 cups for two loaves)
- Honey or dark molasses: 3 tablespoons (or 1/3 cups for two loaves)
- Shortening: 1 tablespoon (or 2 tablespoons for two loaves)
- Salt: 2 teaspoons (or 4 tsp for two loaves)
- Whole wheat flour: 2.25 to 3 cups (or 5.5 to 6 cups for two loaves)

## Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, combine active dry yeast, warm water, honey or dark molasses, shortening, and salt. Stir the mixture well.

2. Slowly add 2.25 to 3 cups of whole wheat flour (or double if making two loaves) to the yeast mixture to form a stiff dough.

3. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead well until it becomes smooth and satiny, about 8 to 10 minutes.

4. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a cloth. Allow it to rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, which should take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.

5. If making two loaves, divide the dough in half. Shape the dough into balls, cover with a bowl, and let them rest for 15 minutes.

6. Shape the dough into loaf forms and place them into well-greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the pans and let the dough rise again until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

7. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.

8. Bake the loaves for 30 to 35 minutes or until they turn deep golden brown.
