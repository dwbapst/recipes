48-hour Homemade Sourdough
   From Ara Kooser

Mix 2 cups flour, 2 cups hot water, 1 TSP salt.

Let stand uncovered for 24 hours.

Then add 1/2 cup flour and warm water til thin. Leave for another 24 hours.

Add flour until the dough becomes tacky. Fold once and hour for three hours. Then bake at 425 in a Dutch oven for 25 mins, uncover and finish for 20 mins.ï»¿

Notes:
 It's basically like making a very quick over-night poolish and then making the entire poolish into a loaf. Seems logical but I hadn't encountered the idea anywhere else, which makes me wonder if there's a reason people don't usually do this.

 Drys out very quickly, at least in South Dakota. Need to cover with plastic wrap or keep in puddle of water with constant over-turning so top of dough doesn't dry out.
 
 Constant addition of flour and water over the 48 hour period mean my end result was about 4 cups of flour, not 2.5 cups.
 
 Smells terrible on inside of loaf for first 24 hours (mix of strong sour and alcohol vapors). Maybe let sit for more than day before trying to eat? Surely, there doesn't seem to be any way that the dough could actual contract food poisoning, as bacteria that harm humans can't live off of flour and water.
 
 Strong pungent taste even after 24 hours has passed; best with butter and cheese. Does not seem to go stale very quickly.
