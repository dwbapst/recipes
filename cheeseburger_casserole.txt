Ingredients:

    2 cups (6 oz) uncooked rotini pasta (use brown rice pasta for GF)
    2 tsp olive oil	
    1 1/2 cups onions, finely chopped
    1 garlic clove, finely chopped
    1 lb lean ground beef (95% lean) / OR VEGGIE GROUND
    3/4 tsp salt
    1/2 tsp black pepper
    2 tbsp tomato paste
    28 oz diced tomatoes
    2 tbsp Dijon Mustard
    2 cups reduced-fat grated cheddar cheese
    1/4 cup chopped dill pickles

Directions:

    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9 x 13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
    In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta according to the package directions for al dente and drain well.
    In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.
    Stir in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
    Stir in the beef and cook until browned; season with salt and pepper.
    Stir in the tomato paste, then add the tomatoes and mustard. Let the mixture bubble gently until it is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
    Toss the meat mixture with the pasta and spread it into the prepared dish.
    Top with the cheddar and bake until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle the chopped pickles over the top and serve.
